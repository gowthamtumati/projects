This project is divided into three parts, and we worked on implementing tiny functions on the LLVM architecture.

Part 1: Getting used to the LLVM commands and capability.

Part 2: Implementing a basic program analysis pass, using the concept of Local Value Numbering

Part 3: Implementing a data-flow analysis pass, using the concept of Liveness Analysis
